<h3>Did you know</h3>
<h4>Energy Costs</h4>
<p>Heating accounts for up to half of the average household energy bill! Older furnaces are typically over-sized and expend more energy than necessary. Even if your old furnace continues to work, it’s costing you considerably more in energy bills than a newer model. Today’s manufacturers design furnaces to satisfy strict performance and safety standards. Energy Smart rebates often apply to these models.</p>
<h4>Energy Savings</h4>
<p>Aries Mechanical Inc. will analyze your home, taking into consideration size, number of rooms local temperatures and provide specific recommendations for cost-effective and efficient heating options. Your comfort is our priority. Aries Mechanical has partnered with Trane® to bring you the best heating investment on the market. Trane® offers a broad range of equipment to suit all budgets and AFUE ratings up to 97%. Meaning 97% of the energy in the fuel becomes heat for your home.</p>
<h4>Furnace Inspections</h4>
<p>The best time to inspect or tune-up your heating system is during the off-season. Make sure you have a certified trained technician provide preventative maintenance. Most manufacturers will not warranty their products if a certified technician isn’t providing the service. Providing preventative maintenance will virtually eliminate sudden repairs and lengthen your system’s lifespan, also improve the quality of air you breathe. Call us today to schedule your annual maintenance.</p>
<h4>Air Quality</h4>
<p>Many Americans spend 90% of their time indoors. Breathing clean air can have an important impact on health. Debris and dust is drawn into your system and will quickly overcome a standard filter and gradually accumulate in the mechanical systems and ductwork. This build up will drag down the performance or efficiency and may cause discomfort, allergies, dust and high utility bills. Aries Mechanical Inc. certified technicians will ensure your HVAC equipment is running safely and at peak performance.</p>
